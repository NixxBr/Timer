This is intended as an attempt of the Arduino Shot timer project (bare bones)

start point is the excellent project - 
https://code.google.com/p/arduino-shot-timer/

intent is to use the Arduino standard Atmel ATMega328 Micro
- Parallel LCD (4x20)
- i2c eeprom to act as non volatile memory (1m write cycles as opposed to internal 50k)
- rotary encoder for navigation / config
- powered by 9v Alkaline
- intended to fit inside plastic 50rnd 9mmp ammo case 


- future 
- communication / connectivity  
	- BLE / BT / Wifi = to smart phone for scorer 
	- NFC - tag reader for competitor / acceptance
- power 
	- 3.7 lipo (rechargeable)
